# Fashion-Recommendation-System

This creates a fashion recommendation system with Machine Learning that will work like highly personalized online shopping recommendations. 

A recommendation system is a system that is programmed to predict future preferable items from a large set of collections. A recommendation system works either by using user preferences or by using the items most preferred by all users. The main challenge in building a fashion recommendation system is that it is a very dynamic industry. It changes very often when it comes to seasons, festivals, pandemic conditions like coronavirus and many more.
